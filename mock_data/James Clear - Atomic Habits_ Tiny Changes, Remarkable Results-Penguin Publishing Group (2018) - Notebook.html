            Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a
            lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even
            greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other
            areas.

            Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning
            can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up
            different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds
            up, like compound interest.”

            you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see
            those kind of people everywhere.

            Outrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a
            long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and
            outrage spreads like wildfire.

            Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to
            unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable,
            then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds
            extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. Similarly,
            habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of
            performance.

            It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core
            reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible
            result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any
            change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside.
            But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this
            plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.

            Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a
            quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and
            look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing
            in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did
            it—but all that had gone before.”

            The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the
            game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about
            the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process
            that will determine your progress.

            Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall
            improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel
            bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both
            small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not
            only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound
            growth.

            Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person
            you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person
            believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that
            belief. For example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who simply
            claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into
            their identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when
            your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are
            simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

            When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and

            The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can
            feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your
            self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any
            level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they
            conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

            The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact,
            the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem,
            which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” Whatever your identity is
            right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty
            years, you have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you have
            evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are
            committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

            Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is
            meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together,
            you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are
            is to change what you do.

            A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The process of habit
            formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to
            make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to
            solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.

            This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the
            useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming. Whenever you face
            a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series
            of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist
            Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

            Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you
            previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this
            memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to
            better predict what will work in the future.

            when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus
            on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more
            of what you want in the future.

            The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*

            First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that
            predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of
            primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict
            secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a
            sense of personal satisfaction.

        <div class="noteText">
            Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of
            motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit
            itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of
            relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth.
            You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire
            to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.

        <div class="noteText">
            The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a
            thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is
            associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are
            willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a
            habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high
            enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.

        <div class="noteText">
            Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing
            the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase
            rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

            If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and
            your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the
            behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then
            you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not
            occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

            We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase
            includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution
            phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you
            desire.

            By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives. Most of us never give
            a second thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster after each
            use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After decades of mental
            programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.

            This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a
            habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it.
            This is what makes habits useful.

            Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more
            challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and
            automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said,
            “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

            The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve
            done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be
            just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether
            it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of
            self-awareness.

            Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad

            If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use:
            “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or
            against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that
            conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

            The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit
            are more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details
            figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say
            when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just
            remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy
            notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote” and transforms
            them into a concrete plan of action.

            When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of
            the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack
            your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. Habit stacking is a special form of an

            The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” For example: Meditation. After I
            pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute. Exercise. After I take off my work
            shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes. Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say
            one thing I’m grateful for that happened today. Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my
            partner a kiss. Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am
            running and how long it will take.

            The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this
            basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to
            take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version
            of the Diderot Effect.

            Your morning routine habit stack might look like this: After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will
            meditate for sixty seconds. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.
            After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.

            You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines. For example, you may already
            have a morning routine that looks like this: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you want to
            develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand your habit stack and try something like: Wake
            up > Make my bed > Place a book on my pillow > Take a shower. Now, when you climb into bed each night, a
            book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.

            When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re

            The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven
            million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate
            that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on
            any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.
            For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can
            imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid
            of unproductive ones.

            cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s

            vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden,

            Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating
            junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same
            can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and
            interacting socially.

            When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience
            pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a
            bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they
            take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in

            The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire
            provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives
            behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads
            to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our
            habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the
            first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.

            also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new
            habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier
            to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way
            to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is off the
            path of your normal commute—even by just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.

            Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires
            the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce
            the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction
            associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make
            future actions easier.

            Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices
            as decisive moments. The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose
            between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or
            grabbing the video game controller.

            The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When
            you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” You’ll find that nearly any habit can be
            scaled down into a two-minute version: “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.” “Do thirty
            minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.” “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.” “Fold the
            laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.” “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”

            Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by
            specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle.
            Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when
            you are going good,” he said.

            Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you
            show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new
            identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person who
            doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be. We
            rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better
            than not exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is
            better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.

            Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours
            afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send
            you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start
            a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process,
            the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great
            things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.

            Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an
            inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling
            to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more
            difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device.

            The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you
            make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior
            is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic
            savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
            Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right
            behavior.
